Custom actions bar component. This bar contains a row of buttons corresponding to custom-defined actions via the `actions` input property. Whenever the user clicks a button, the `actionRequest` event is emitted.

To use this component, set the actions and handle the `actionRequest` event. Optionally, you can set additional data in the payload property, which will be passed back to the `actionRequest` handler.

Each custom action is defined by an object implementing `BarCustomAction`.
